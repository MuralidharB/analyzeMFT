This document lists the changes and version history for the AnalyzeMFT script and component scripts.

## Version 3.0 (2024-08-15)

Work has completed on the class-based layout. The program has been split into individual files each composed of the class within. 
I believe this is the way to go (personal preference) as I like to work on one module at a time!


### To do list:

1. Implement a testing framework involving the sister project [GenerateMFT](https://github.com/rowingdude/GenerateMFT/).
2. Implement multithreading as an option
3. Complete a more succinct and visually appealing menu system (âœ… 16-Aug-24 )

# Repository Updates:
## August 2nd, 2024:
- On 30-July-2024 it seems my automated repository management went awry. Instead of a simple push/pull to refresh the branches, I wrongly set to merge the testing branch into the master branch, causing quite a bit of chaos. The CI/CD pipeline took a hit, but we'll get things back on track. Over the past couple days, I've restored the old files and incorporated the necessary reworks. To keep things organized, I've moved the "new" materials to a dedicated "testing" folder, while the mildly updated files remain in the master branch. As an added measure, I've implemented branch protections on the master branch. From now on, every change will require a "sign off" and a pull request. Once we're back to normal operations, these protections will be strictly enforced.
